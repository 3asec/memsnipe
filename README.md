## Setup and Installation

To get started with MemSnipe, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/3asec/memsnipe.git
cd memsnipe
```


2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
Add your private key and any other environment variables required by the bot in this file.
Example .env:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

4. Configure Bot Settings
Define your entry settings in main.py:
Set the minimum entry amount (e.g., 0.0005 ETH).
Specify the minimum follower count for deployers to ensure credibility.
Running the Bot
To start the bot, run:

```
python main.py
```

Usage Notes
Transaction Monitoring:
The bot will scan and execute transactions based on your criteria.
Transaction ID: After each successful transaction, the bot will display the transaction ID for your records.

Token Sales:
You can sell tokens manually or use other sniper bots (e.g., Sigma) for automated selling.

Auto Take-Profit (TP) and Cut-Loss (CL):
Auto TP & CL: The bot supports automatic take-profit (TP) and cut-loss (CL) functionality. This allows you to set profit and loss levels, and the bot will automatically execute sales when the price hits your target.
Alternatively, you can set your TP and CL levels manually via the Sigma bot if you prefer more control over your trades.

Important Notes:
Ensure the .env file is configured correctly, as it contains your private key and other sensitive information.
This bot requires a 2% transaction fee, automatically deducted from each successful snipe.

Disclaimer:
Use it at your own risk and be aware of the inherent risks in trading and automated transactions on the blockchain.
